List packages in the venv:
Activate your venv and run:

pip freeze > venv_requirements.txt
List packages in the system-wide Python:
Deactivate the venv and run:

pip freeze > system_requirements.txt
Compare the two files:
You can use a diff tool or simply view both files to identify differences.

Install missing packages in the system-wide Python:

pip install -r venv_requirements.txt

Alignment with Venv:
If there are still discrepancies between your system-wide Python and the venv, you can generate a requirements file from the venv and apply it to the system-wide Python:

bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
