# Model Zoos

A **Model Zoo** is a collection of pre-trained machine learning models, often optimized for specific hardware or frameworks. These model repositories make it easier for developers and researchers to deploy, test, and experiment with models without having to build them from scratch.

## ONNX Model Zoo
The **ONNX Model Zoo** is a rich collection of pre-trained models in the **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)** format. These models are sourced from open-source repositories and contributions from the community. ONNX enables a standardized format that ensures compatibility across different frameworks, tools, and runtimes, which is ideal for cross-platform deployment.

Key Features:
- **Standardized format** for interoperability.
- **Git LFS** (Large File Storage) to manage large model files.
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/onnx/models) for accessing models.

## Intel Model Zoo
The **Intel Model Zoo** offers a comprehensive selection of optimized deep learning models tailored for Intel hardware, such as CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators. These models are part of Intel's broader AI software stack, enabling high-performance inference and training.

Key Features:
- **Optimized for Intel hardware** (CPUs, GPUs, VPUs).
- **Includes pre-trained models** and deployment scripts.
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo) for easy access.

## i-Rockchip Model Zoo
The **i-Rockchip Model Zoo** focuses on AI models optimized for **Rockchip** hardware, especially designed for efficient inference on embedded and edge devices. It includes models for various applications, including vision, speech, and edge computing.

Key Features:
- **Tailored for Rockchip's AI accelerators**.
- **Pre-trained models** for vision, speech, and edge computing.
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rknn-model-zoo) for quick access.

There are also several other **model zoos** from companies like NVIDIA, but my personal experience is primarily with Intel and Rockchip-based devices.
