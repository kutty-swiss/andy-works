## Devices used
1) Raspberry Pi
2) Orange Pi 5 Plus with 16 GB RAM, 6 TOPS NPU Processor with really good hardware specs
3) AWOW AK-10 Pro
4) Intel Nuc 12 i5 with 32 GB RAM ( Self configured to complete PC from barebone)

   Each of the above devices have their own advantages.

## Self Hosting

_Selfhosting on linux"! :wave:_

**Why self hosting?**: I started with selfhosting after fiddling with Raspberry Pi4. Validated a number of Versions of Raspberry Pi4
<br>: Muliboot OS Loaders: Noobs, Berry Boot
<br>: Operating Systems: Raspbian, Debian, Ubuntu, Dietpi, Kali Linux, Gentoo. Each of these OS has some features and with resource utilization and ease of use, finally settled with Dietpi. This is one of my nodes where multiple servers are running.

## Artificial Intelligence

**What is special?**: Without any arguements, i acknowledge the learning i could take from Aritificial Intelligence.
In my case I was able to learn & meet my objectives with AI quickly. This helped me to reduce time spent for fixing stuff.


Usecases:
1.Writing Shell scripts for OS Automation
2.Yaml file for deploying docker containers
3.Setting up & automatically configuring multiple servers
