# Introduction  
I am a passionate software engineer, with a strong motivation for self-learning. Thanks to affordable, power-efficient hardware, I could learn and practice:  

- **Self-Hosting on Linux**  
- **Artificial Intelligence**  

## Devices Used  
- [Raspberry Pi](raspi4.md) (Extremely low power consumption, used for running lightweight servers and various projects.)
- [Orange Pi 5 Plus](orangepi5Plus.md) (Energy efficient, PCIe 3.0 x4 interface for faster storage expansion with compatible SSDs, features powerful AI processing capabilities.)
- [AWOW AK-10 Pro](awow-ak10pro.md) (Energy efficient, PCIe 3.0 x4 interface for faster storage expansion with compatible SSDs, compact and versatile mini-PC for everyday use.)
- [Intel NUC 12 i5](nuc12i5.md) (32 GB RAM, self-configured to a complete PC from barebone, suitable for intensive workloads and media editing.)


Each of the above devices has its own advantages.  

## Self-Hosting  
### Self-hosting on Linux! ðŸ‘‹  

#### Why Self-Hosting?  
I started with self-hosting after fiddling with Raspberry Pi 4. I validated multiple versions of Raspberry Pi 4.
The main aim was to have data stored prviately and a bit of public data processing to render for all the devices in home intranet. <Br>
Filesharing was already supported by my router, but with sharing via pc it has much more advanges like nginx file sharing etc. Though it is not comparable to NAS, i used rsync to keep important docs in sync accross multiple devices. <Br>

#### Multi-boot OS Loaders:  
- NOOBS  
- BerryBoot  

#### Operating Systems:  
- Raspbian  
- Debian  
- Ubuntu  
- DietPi  
- Kali Linux  
- Gentoo  

Each of these OSes has unique features. Considering resource utilization and ease of use, I finally settled on **DietPi**. This is one of my nodes where multiple servers are running.  

## Artificial Intelligence  
### What is special?  
Without any arguments, I acknowledge the learning I could gain from **Artificial Intelligence**.  

In my case, I was able to learn and meet my objectives with AI quickly. This helped me reduce the time spent fixing issues.  

### Use Cases:  
- Writing **shell scripts** for OS automation  
- YAML files for **deploying Docker containers**  
- Setting up & automatically configuring **multiple servers**
