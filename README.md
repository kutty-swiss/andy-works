# Introduction  
I am a passionate software engineer, with a strong motivation for self-learning. Thanks to affordable, power-efficient hardware, I could learn and practice:  

- **Self-Hosting on Linux**  
- **Artificial Intelligence**  

## Devices Used  
- **Raspberry Pi**  
- **Orange Pi 5 Plus** (16 GB RAM, 6 TOPS NPU Processor with really good hardware specs)  
- **AWOW AK-10 Pro**  
- **Intel NUC 12 i5** (32 GB RAM, self-configured to a complete PC from barebone)  

Each of the above devices has its own advantages.  

## Self-Hosting  
### Self-hosting on Linux! ðŸ‘‹  

#### Why Self-Hosting?  
I started with self-hosting after fiddling with Raspberry Pi 4. I validated multiple versions of Raspberry Pi 4.  

#### Multi-boot OS Loaders:  
- NOOBS  
- BerryBoot  

#### Operating Systems:  
- Raspbian  
- Debian  
- Ubuntu  
- DietPi  
- Kali Linux  
- Gentoo  

Each of these OSes has unique features. Considering resource utilization and ease of use, I finally settled on **DietPi**. This is one of my nodes where multiple servers are running.  

## Artificial Intelligence  
### What is special?  
Without any arguments, I acknowledge the learning I could gain from **Artificial Intelligence**.  

In my case, I was able to learn and meet my objectives with AI quickly. This helped me reduce the time spent fixing issues.  

### Use Cases:  
- Writing **shell scripts** for OS automation  
- YAML files for **deploying Docker containers**  
- Setting up & automatically configuring **multiple servers**
